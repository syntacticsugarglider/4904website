# Week One

For the past week, Team 4904 has been energetically designing, prototyping, and testing the hardware, software, and electronics of our 2019 robot.

On kickoff, students from Team 4904 and Team 5026 met to watch the game reveal for FIRST Destination: Deep Space. We then reviewed the game manual and discussed potential strategies in small groups, which culminated in a rough priority list of what we wanted to pursue. After that, Design and Fabrication began prototyping ways to manipulate hatch panels, as well as building field elements. Electronics wired a test board, and started developing a setup for vision tests. Programming worked on updating their year-after-year libraries, preparing their development environments for build season, and writing code for the various prototypes.

Throughout the week, Design and Fabrication continued refining various prototypes, in preparation for a design review during Week 2. They also continued making field elements and designing the drivetrain, which was finalized at our meeting on Thursday. Electronics continued building test boards, setting up Altium, and designing PCB layouts. Programming continued developing code for the prototypes, vision-based auto-alignment, a shuffleboard UI for the driver station, and streaming cameras for the drivers.

Next week, we plan to finalize our prototypes, begin CAD of our full robot, start fabricating the drivetrain, make PCBs, and review our prototype code. Check back next week to see how we do!
