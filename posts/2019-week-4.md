# Week Four

During Week 4, Team 4904 completed the drivetrain, wired it, and tested the basic driving code. Fabrication, after assembling and tuning the first drivetrain and continuing work on the second drivetrain, began part fabrication for the elevator. Electronics continued debugging CAN and working on LEDs for the robot, while also working on and finalizing the design for a custom PCB. Design finished the plans for the elevator and began finalizing the design for the rest of the robot, including the manipulator, four-bar mechanism, and mounting points for the cameras. Programming continued work on vision, testing and developing their retroreflective tape detection and math, while working on automatic system health checks for the pit, and beginning floor tape detection as another method of auto alignment

Next week, we plan to finalize the rest of our design, continue vision development and code reviews, finish CAN testing and continue robot fabrication.
