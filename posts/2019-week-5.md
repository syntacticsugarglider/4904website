# Week Five

Team 4904 made significant strides during week 5, finishing the superstructure design and continuing work on the competition work. Design finished the superstructure, handing the full CAD off to fabrication, who continued building the first superstructure and second drivetrain. Despite some initial challenges with chain tensioning for the drivetrain, the fabrication team persevered, managing to finish the majority of the elevator by the end of the week. Programming continued work on vision and finished reviewing prototype code, while also doing some work on their splines/pathfinding offseason project. Electronics began ordering their custom PCBs, finished CAN testing for our TX2 processor, and continued their work with LEDs.

Next week, we plan to finish up the first robot and second drivetrain, in order to hand them both off to electronics and programming!
