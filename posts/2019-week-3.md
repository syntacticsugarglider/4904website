# Week Three

Team 4904 spent Week 3 working on superstructure design, completing drivetrain fabrication, fixing CAN for the TX2, revising prototype code, and improving vision and streaming systems.

Early in the week, Design completed a draft of the final robot design, so the entire team, along with some mentors and other guests, met on Monday afternoon to review the final design. For the rest of the week, Design incorporated the suggestions from the design review into the CAD, and continued iterating on designs for the hatch and cargo manipulator. Fabrication continued work on the drivetrain, completing part manufacturing, assembled drivetrain 1, and began bumper production. Electronics continued designing PCBs, worked on integrating CAN with the TX2, the voltage booster board, and set up LEDs. Programming worked on a variety of projects, including making edits to prototype code, working on image stitching for the two-camera vision system, setting up automatic health checks, and splines.

Next week, we plan to install drivetrain electronics, begin superstructure fabrication, and continue making progress on vision and autonomous code projects.
